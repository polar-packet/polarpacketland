        <h2>About the Role</h2>
        <p>
        The Technical Data Consultant works closely with clients to help them solve real data challenges, design practical solutions and build a foundation they can trust. You will be the person who turns loosely defined problems into clear plans, guiding clients through data strategy, architecture choices and the steps needed to get their pipelines and analytics into shape.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
        You will dive into client data environments, assess gaps and recommend the right approaches to improve reliability, scalability and clarity. This includes advising on data pipelines, integrations and storage decisions, working with engineering teams to implement solutions and helping clients understand how to use their data more effectively for analytics and automation.
        </p>

        <h3>What We're Looking For</h3>
        <p>
        We are looking for someone who has a strong technical foundation, enjoys problem solving and communicates clearly with both technical and non technical stakeholders. You should be comfortable working across different tools and architectures, have experience with modern data practices and be eager to guide clients toward smarter and more scalable data decisions.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Join Us</h3>
        <p>
        You will get the chance to work on a wide range of client challenges, explore modern data stacks and shape solutions that make a visible impact. You will be part of a collaborative team that values curiosity, ownership and steady growth, giving you room to expand your skills while working with interesting and fast moving businesses.
        </p>
