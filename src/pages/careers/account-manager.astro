    <h2>About the Role</h2>
    <p>
      The Account Manager is the steady partner our clients rely on to keep projects running smoothly and communication clear. You will build strong relationships, understand each client's goals and make sure the work we deliver lines up with their expectations and long term plans.
    </p>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      You will oversee day to day client interactions, coordinate with internal teams and ensure all deliverables land on time and at the quality clients expect. This includes managing project timelines, gathering requirements, flagging risks early and keeping everyone aligned so the workflow stays efficient and predictable.
    </p>

    <h3>What We're Looking For</h3>
    <p>
      We are looking for someone who communicates well, stays organized and enjoys building genuine client relationships. You should feel comfortable guiding conversations, handling shifting priorities and helping clients articulate what they need. Experience in account management or client facing roles is valuable, especially in tech or data driven environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Join Us</h3>
    <p>
      You will work with a range of growing businesses and be part of a team that values clarity, collaboration and trust. You will have the freedom to shape how clients experience our services and play a key role in keeping partnerships strong as we continue to grow.
